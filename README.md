# css-exercise-two

In this rep I forked code from Chris Courtney, our Design Director at the time and:

1) Learned that he got a parking ticket.

2) Learned how to apply hierarchy in code by using targeted classes to change fonts sizes.

3) Fixed broken image links.

4) Adjusted line height to something sane.
